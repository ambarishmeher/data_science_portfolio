Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files .

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/ambarishmeher/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/ambarishmeher/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/ambarishmeher/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/smart_cab/smartcab.ipynb): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.

	Tools: scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

	Tools: scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Tensorflow, Keras
